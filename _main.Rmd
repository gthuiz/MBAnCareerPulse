# Intro {-#intro}

Welcome to the MBAn Career Pulse site! This site will serve as a comprehensive guide on the exciting job market that awaits our inaugural class of MBAn students.  We're hoping that you'll be able to better understand how data is the "heartbeat" that drives all business through using our Pulse site.

## MBAn at Michigan {-#mban-at-michigan}

Our cohort of 52 students has a diverse background and set of skills and we are gaining a foundation in both data analytics and business management through this program.  After completing the 10-month, full-time residential program we'll have many options to choose from when it comes to our desired career paths.  We'll cover a few interesting ones and expand on their salary expectations as well as companies or cities we might end up in.

<!--chapter:end:index.Rmd-->

# Other Programs in the US {-#other-programs-in-the-us}

After this 1st cohort graduates it will be clear to the rest of the world that MBAn at Michigan is the #1 program in the country (GO BLUE)! Until then, we'll have to rely on data from other schools whose programs are similar.  The list below is not exhaustive, but it includes those who have prestige and recognition similar to UofM.  

The rankings for the MBA programs help gauge the overall prestige and difficulty of the business school.  Those rankings come from [US News 2023 Report](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools).  The MBAn rankings come from the [QS World University 2022 Report](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/business-masters-rankings/business-analytics/2022).
